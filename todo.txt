TODO:

1 - Options Component: Reset option's validations error message when delete options is called 
Example: send empty value to form, error message called, and then call delete all options
but the error message remains.

2 - Option Component: Add % chance of option being picked next to each option.
Sudo: 1 divided by options.length returns % chance of option being picked.
